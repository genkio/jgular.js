> The goal here is to apply what I learned from the book [Build Your Own Angular](https://teropa.info/build-your-own-angular/), to build my very own yet another JavaScript framework, wait for it...jgular.js!!!

Features implemented so far
---
- Basic dirty-checking system in terms of $watch and $digest.
- Several scope methods ($eval, $apply, $evalAsync and $applyAsync) that can access scopes to evaluate code and to cause dirty-checking to be triggered.
